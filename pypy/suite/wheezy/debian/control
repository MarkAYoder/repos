Description: fast alternative implementation of Python - PyPy interpreter
 PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language
 (2.7). It has several advantages and distinct features:
  * Speed: thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler (on x86), Python programs often
    run faster on PyPy.
  * Memory usage: large, memory-hungry Python programs might end up taking less
    space than they do in CPython.
  * Compatibility: PyPy is highly compatible with existing Python code.
    It supports ctypes and can run popular Python libraries like twisted and
    django.
  * Stackless: PyPy supports stackless mode on x86, providing
    micro-threads for massive concurrency.
 .
 This package contains the PyPy interpreter.

Description: sandboxed PyPy interpreter
 A version of PyPy that runs fully "virtualized", where an external process
 controls all input/output. This is a secure sandbox, it is safe to run any
 untrusted Python code with it. The Python code cannot see or modify any local
 file except via interaction with the external process.

Description: standard library for PyPy (an alternative Python interpreter)
 The PyPy standard library. This is a combination of modules, copied directly
 from cpython, modified cpython modules, and modules entirely re-implemented
 (usually in pure Python, where they are C extensions in cpython).

 Header files for compiling cpython C extension modules for use with PyPy.
 Note that pure Python modules will probably perform better.
 .
 PyPy supports a subset of cpython's C API through its CPyExt subsystem.
