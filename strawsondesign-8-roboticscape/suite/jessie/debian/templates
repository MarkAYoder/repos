Description: Which program to run on boot?
 Please select a program to run on boot. The default value is 'rc_blink' which will flash the green and red LEDs on boot to indicate all if working. For BeagleMiP select 'rc_balance'. If you have your own roboticscape project set to run on boot and wish to leave it alone then select existing. To do nothing on boot select 'none'.
