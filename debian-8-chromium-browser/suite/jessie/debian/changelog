chromium-browser (55.0.2883.87-0ubuntu2.1328) zesty; urgency=medium

  * debian/rules: Build extra codecs as part of main chromium program,
    and libre/crippled/h.264less on its own. Seems to make h.264 work 
    again. Weird.
  * debian/chromium-browser.links: Make link to ./ instead of / to fix
    path problems that codec-using other apps might see.
