# fsprotect configuration for protecting filesystems other than root
# Protection will only be enabled when the "fsprotect=" parameter is passed to
# the kernel

# This is a space separated list of mountpoints to protect.
# Only non-virtual filesystems are supported.
# DON'T add / in here. Instead use the "fsprotect=" kernel parameter
# Each entry is in the form "mountpoint" or "mountpoint=tmpfs_size"
# Example:
#	PROTECT="/boot=100M /home=2G"
PROTECT=""
