Description: Helper scripts to make filesystems immutable
 This is a set of scripts that make immutable the root and other filesystems.
 Using aufs they pack a tmpfs filesystem and the filesystem forcing
 changes to be written to the tmpfs.
 .
 The root filesystem is protected by an initramfs script. Other filesystems
 are protected by an init script. All protected filesystems become read-only
 ensuring their immutability even on power-offs.
 .
 This can be used for public computers to prevent damage or changes.
