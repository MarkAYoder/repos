    - re-added dependency on ruby-simplecov-html
  * Update packaging with a new dh-make-ruby run

ruby-simplecov (0.7.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Break dependency cycle with simplecov-html (Closes: #723199)
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5 (no changes)
  * Update Build-Depends for ruby2.0, drop ruby1.8 support.
    While simplecov's own tests don't seem to run on 2.0, running tests
    of other packages works (or at least, doesn't break).
  * Fix test failure due to encoding test (from upstream)
