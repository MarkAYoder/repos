  * debian/rules, debian/chromium-codecs-ffmpeg{,-extra}.install: ffmpeg is a
    first-class component library now, not a special snowflake. Still, build
    it differently, but build flags are different. 
  * debian/tests/smoketest-actual: Remove some innocuous mentions of "error"
    before testing for actual errors.
  * debian/control: codec library packages replace the libffmpeg.so that 
    was in chromium packages before now.
  * debian/control: codec packages can't reasonably be updated separately 
    than chromium. Depend with version specification also.
